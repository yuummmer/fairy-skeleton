# What to submit where (quick hints)

- **GEO** (expression matrices + metadata): Sample sheet (CSV/TSV), raw/processed files, metadata with organism, platform, etc.
- **SRA/ENA** (raw sequencing): Run/experiment metadata, FASTQ files, library layout.
- **Zenodo** (general data): Dataset description, creators, license, related DOIs.

This is a placeholder for v0.1; weâ€™ll ship richer, repository-specific checklists in v0.2.
